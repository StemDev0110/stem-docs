# Intro

## Development

During my development phase, I enjoy creating a diverse range of innovative projects. These are available for access and use solely for research purposes, with commercial use expressly prohibited. My intention in sharing them is to promote the open-source philosophy and contribute to the advancement of the community.

## Articles

Within my articles, I delve into an array of theories and ideas that I perceive as potential solutions to various contemporary issues. I find pleasure in meticulously documenting diverse subjects, refining concepts, and producing research articles, among other pursuits.

## Uncensored

Personally, I advocate for avoiding data censorship and expression limitations in all aspects of life. That's why I promote the free expression of all types of sensitive data.
